            Let's think step-by-step. 
            Use a scratchpad to record your thoughts. First, identify all groups of peaks and the corresponding number of hydrogens, and ensure the stoichiometry of the formula matches that in the spectrum Then, for each group of peaks, hypothesize one or more molecule fragments that could explain the signals in that peak.
            Rank the hypotheses according to which is most plausible
            Occasionally synthesize a candidate molecule from the provisionally-assigned fragments
            Be mindful of connectivity and ensure consistency with all hypothesized fragments

            What's the molecule's name? Let's think step-by-step. 
            Use a scratchpad to record your thoughts, and continuing using it until your confident about your answer. 
            
            Before the analysis of NMR spectra, think about the molecular formula. Is the molecule fully saturated, or are there some multiple bonds or rings?
            Consider the solvent used. Do you expect the appearance of signals from exchangeable hydrogens (e.g., in CDCl3or DMSO), or are they exchanged to deuterium (e.g. in D2O or methanol-d4)? 
            Identify solvent signals and ignore them in the structural analysis.
            Consider the number of signals, their positions (chemical shifts), intensity, shape and splitting.
            The number of signals corresponds to the number of non-equivalent atoms in the molecule.
            Typical regions in proton NMR spectra are: carboxylic acids: 10–13 ppm, aldehydes: 9–11 ppm, aromatic hydrogens: 6.5–8 ppm, hydrogens attached to a double-bond carbon: 4–7.5 ppm, O–CH fragments (alcohols, ethers): 3–5 ppm, hydrogens attached to a triple-bond carbon: 2–3.5 ppm, hydrogens attached to a single-bond carbon without an electronegative substituent: 0.5–2.5 ppm.

            Let's think step-by-step using both logical analysis and expert knowledge.
            
            Use a scratchpad to:
            1. Identify all groups of peaks and corresponding hydrogens
            2. Ensure stoichiometry matches the formula
            3. For each peak group, hypothesize possible molecular fragments
            4. Rank hypotheses by plausibility
            5. Build candidate molecules from fragments
            
            Consider these expert guidelines:
            - Check if the molecule is fully saturated or has multiple bonds/rings
            - Look for exchangeable hydrogens based on solvent
            - Note typical chemical shift regions:
              * 10-13 ppm: carboxylic acids
              * 9-11 ppm: aldehydes
              * 6.5-8 ppm: aromatic hydrogens
              * 4-7.5 ppm: alkene hydrogens
              * 3-5 ppm: O-CH fragments
              * 2-3.5 ppm: alkyne hydrogens
              * 0.5-2.5 ppm: alkyl hydrogens
